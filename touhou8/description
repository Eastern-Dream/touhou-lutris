REQUIREMENTS:
- Original JP Touhou 8 game directory any version 1.00-1.00d (English pre-patched one may not work!)
- System JP locale enabled (https://web.archive.org/web/20240126214334/https://www.visualnovelwiki.org/en/general/jp-locale - your distro may not be listed in there, but do your own research to figure out how to). Pay attention to the Lutris Flatpak configuration if you are using it!

THIS INSTALLER PROVIDES:
- Run ZUN patches to update the game to the latest version
- vpatch
- Latest thcrap
- A batch helper script to manipulate thcrap created launch shortcuts

HELPER SCRIPT EXPLANATION - This installer script also includes batch script that does the following:
- Look for all *.lnk file in Desktop directory
- Enumerate found .lnk from 1 to n and ask user for input in choosing the .lnk
- If chosen .lnk has 'custom' in it (meaning it is the game configuration tool), it will open it immediately. This allows you to edit the game config.
- If chosen .lnk does not have 'custom' (meaning it is launch shortcut for the game with patches), it will set that .lnk as the main game executable for Lutris.

The reason for this is Lutris requires a static location for the main game executable, but patching creates a different set of shortcuts each time you create a patch stack. The solution is to have a script that help you choose which shortcut is the main game executable. This also means that Steam Deck users can dynamically choose between patches and enter game configuration tool or run patch configuration all within the Flatpak Lutris launch options in Desktop mode without having to manually edit by hand.

ZUN PATCHES - There will be three total running ZUN patches and you need to know how to navigate them to patch your game directory to the latest version. Failing to follow instructions to patch to the latest version will cause thcrap to not work! You also need to know what game version that you had in the first place, 'readme.txt' will tell you what game version you are on.
- The first popup will basically ask if you are intending to patch from version X to version Y
- If you choose yes, it will open a new popup asking for the path of the game directory.
- Click on the very right-most button (not Cancel!) opens a directory picker, you need to navigate to, and pick the directory "C:\Program Files\th08"
- Continue through the patching process and close when done.
- For the last 2 ZUN patches, on a successful patch after the first directory picking popup, there will be another popup for patching 1.00c to 1.00d, simply continue as normal.
If you are completely clueless about any of this, just click yes and continue through everything, picking the directory every time that was asked for. Repeat or selectively skip this process for all three patchers if you know what you are doing.

TROUBLESHOOTING/FAQ:
- If you have no sound, toggle 'Prefer system library'.
- Closing thcrap configuration tool or the main game executable creates a hanging process, this is annoying but fortunately a non-issue, just click 'Stop' in Lutris to force close background processes. This also affects Steam Deck game mode, simply tap B when quitting game to force close background processes.
